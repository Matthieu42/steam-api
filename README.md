A Java library to retrieve data from Valves Steam platform. It uses the [Steam Storefront API](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI), which is not inteded for public use and may change anytime (it already happened). I try to react as quickly as possible when this happens and release a new compatible version, but features might be changed or missing.

## Usage

```java
package com.github.goive.steamapidemo;

import com.github.goive.steamapi.data.SteamApp;
import com.github.goive.steamapi.enums.CountryCode;

public class DemoApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SteamApi steamApi = SteamApiFactory.createSteamApi(CountryCode.AT);
        SteamApp steamApp = steamApi.retrieveApp(70L); // appId of Half-Life
    }

}
```

This retrieves almost all available data for the given Steam ID including prices and discounts.

## Stable Release

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.go-ive</groupId>
    <artifactId>steam-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Direct Download

Or download the JAR directly from [Maven Central](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/com/github/go-ive/steam-api/3.0.1/steam-api-3.0.1.jar).

## Nightly Build

If you are interested in the version currently in the master branch, you can use the SNAPSHOT version. I do not recommend this for production use as this build is changing. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.go-ive</groupId>
    <artifactId>steam-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
