A Java library to retrieve data from Valve's Steam platform. It uses the [Steam Storefront API](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI), which is not inteded for public use and may change anytime (it already happened). I try to react as quickly as possible when this happens and release a new compatible version, but features might be changed or missing.

## Usage

```java
package com.github.goive.steamapidemo;

import com.github.goive.steamapi.SteamApi;
import com.github.goive.steamapi.SteamApiFactory;
import com.github.goive.steamapi.data.Price;
import com.github.goive.steamapi.data.SteamApp;
import com.github.goive.steamapi.data.SteamId;
import com.github.goive.steamapi.enums.CountryCode;

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.Currency;

public class DemoApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SteamApi steamApi = SteamApiFactory.createSteamApi(CountryCode.AT);

        SteamId steamIdOfHalfLife = SteamId.create("70");

        SteamApp steamApp = steamApi.retrieveApp(steamIdOfHalfLife);

        Price price = steamApp.getPrice();

        BigDecimal currentPriceOfApp = price.getFinalPrice();
        BigDecimal priceBeforeDiscount = price.getInitialPrice();
        int discountPercentage = price.getDiscountPercent();
        Currency currency = price.getCurrency();

        // other info also available in steamApp object...
    }

}
```

This retrieves almost all available data for the given Steam ID including prices and discounts.

## Stable Release

### Gradle

```gradle
compile 'com.github.go-ive:steam-api:4.1'

## Nightly Build

If you are interested in the version currently in the master branch, you can use the SNAPSHOT version. I do not recommend this for production use as this build is changing. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.go-ive</groupId>
    <artifactId>steam-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
